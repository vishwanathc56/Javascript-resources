```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}
```

Iteration 1 (i = 0):

setTimeout schedules a callback function (() => { console.log(i); }) to be executed after 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
At this point, i is 0.
The loop continues.
Iteration 2 (i = 1):

setTimeout schedules another callback function with the same body (console.log(i);) to be executed after 1 second.
Now, i is 1.
The loop continues.
Iteration 3 (i = 2):

setTimeout schedules another callback function with the same body (console.log(i);) to be executed after 1 second.
Now, i is 2.
The loop continues.
Iteration 4 (i = 3):

setTimeout schedules another callback function with the same body (console.log(i);) to be executed after 1 second.
Now, i is 3.
The loop continues.
Iteration 5 (i = 4):

setTimeout schedules another callback function with the same body (console.log(i);) to be executed after 1 second.
Now, i is 4.
The loop condition (i < 5) evaluates to false because i is now 5.
The loop terminates.
Now, let's discuss the execution of the setTimeout callbacks:

After 1 second, the first callback (console.log(i); where i is 5) executes.
After 1 second, the second callback (console.log(i); where i is 5) executes.
After 1 second, the third callback (console.log(i); where i is 5) executes.
After 1 second, the fourth callback (console.log(i); where i is 5) executes.
After 1 second, the fifth callback (console.log(i); where i is 5) executes.
In all cases, when the callbacks execute, they access the variable i from the outer scope of the loop. At the time of execution, i has already been incremented to 5 because the loop has completed by then. Therefore, each callback prints 5 to the console.

This behavior happens because JavaScript's closures capture variables by reference, not by value, and they retain the reference to the variable i. When the callbacks execute, they all reference the same variable i, which by the time they execute, has already been incremented to 5 after the loop has finished.
